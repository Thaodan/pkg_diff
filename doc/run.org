#+TITLE: pkg_diff run
this document discribes how pkg_diff runs and what is does._

* Init 
** Config 
First config is readed either of: 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$HOME/.config/pkg_diff.conf
#+END_SRC
or
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$PWD/.pkg_diff.conf
#+END_SRC
Or nowhere if none of them are present.
For it's content see: [[./config.org][config]]
** Parse Options
   Then options are parsed as described in the options files in /src/options/.
   This is an example opt file:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# options:
# -P        use pager
# -C        colored output
# -d  <arg> diff args
# -l  <arg> less args 
args=sPCd:l:
arg_func=option_diff
option_diff()
{
    case $arg in
        P) pager=true ;;
        C) color=true ;;
        d) diff_args="$OPTARG";;
        l) less_args="$OPTARG" ;;
    esac
}
#+END_SRC
First the /args/ var is stored in the global args var, 
same as for the arg_func var.

Than the actual arguments are taken and checked if 
valid against the parsed /args/.

After this all parsed arg func are called to do their job for each parsed arg.
* Prepare 
Each file as present in the pkgbuild is downloaded to the target dir as set in 
/lib/conf/.
* Diff Part
Diff downloaded files by original files
* Destroy/End
Remove downloaded target dirs.
